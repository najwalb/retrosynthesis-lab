# Install Python dependencies.
# Torch must land BEFORE the PyG packages (torch-scatter / torch-sparse / etc.):
# those packages don't declare torch as a build dep but import it at the top of
# setup.py to detect build flags. With modern pip's resolver, all packages are
# collected before any install runs, so if torch-scatter falls through to a
# source build (no matching wheel for the platform), `import torch` fails.
# Installing torch first sidesteps that whole class of build-order errors.
